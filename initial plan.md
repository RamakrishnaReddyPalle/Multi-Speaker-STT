Excellent vision — you're describing a powerful real-time audio processing pipeline that could become the backend for AI meeting assistants, transcribers, or chrome-based tools. Here's your detailed **end-to-end plan** to build this using the best open-source models available today:

---

## 🚀 End-to-End Audio Intelligence Pipeline

### 🔧 High-Level Steps

```
[Input Audio]
    ⬇
[1. Noise Cancellation]
    ⬇
[2. Speech Enhancement]
    ⬇
[3. Multi-Speaker Separation]
    ⬇
[4. Speaker-wise ASR (STT)]
    ⬇
[5. Conversation Logging / Structuring]
    ⬇
[6. Endpoint / Chrome Extension Delivery]
```

---

### ✅ 1. Noise Cancellation

#### 🔍 Goal:

Remove background noise (e.g., fans, traffic, keyboard sounds)

#### ✅ Open-source options:

* **RNNoise** (lightweight, real-time, WebAssembly possible)
* **Demucs (Hybrid)** with `--denoise` flag
* **DeepFilterNet v3** (SOTA, runs in real-time, uses GRU)

#### 🔧 Suggestion:

Start with **DeepFilterNet v3** (PyTorch + real-time)

```bash
pip install deepfilternet
```

---

### ✅ 2. Speech Enhancement

#### 🔍 Goal:

Improve intelligibility of speech (clarity, de-reverberation, etc.)

#### ✅ Open-source models:

* **SEGAN / MetricGAN+** (Torch-based)
* **VoiceFixer** (used in speech restoration pipelines)
* **Wavesplit + Demucs** hybrid

#### 🔧 Suggestion:

Use **VoiceFixer** for strong enhancement (Python inference ready)

---

### ✅ 3. Multi-Speaker Separation

#### 🔍 Goal:

Separate mixed voices in a single-channel meeting audio

#### ✅ Best open models:

* **Neural Spleeter / Conv-TasNet / Demucs v4**
* **SepFormer** from SpeechBrain
* **Wavesplit** (waveform-based + speaker-embedding aware)

#### 🔧 Suggestion:

Use **Demucs v4** for best trade-off (real-time possible + well maintained)

---

### ✅ 4. Speaker-wise STT (Speech to Text)

#### 🔍 Goal:

For each separated speaker, generate real-time or batch transcripts

#### ✅ Open-source models:

* **Whisper (Tiny/Base) + VAD + Diarization**
* **Silero STT** (lightweight)
* **NVIDIA NeMo + QuartzNet or Conformer-Tiny**

#### 🔧 Suggestion:

* Use **Whisper Tiny** for accurate multilingual ASR (quantizable)
* Use **Silero VAD + pyannote-audio** for diarization if needed

---

### ✅ 5. Conversation Logging

#### 🔍 Goal:

Maintain structured, timestamped logs of each speaker’s utterances

#### Format:

```json
{
  "timestamp": "00:01:05",
  "speaker": "Speaker 1",
  "text": "We should finalize the report today."
}
```

#### Tools:

* `sqlite` or `jsonl` file
* Simple API layer using FastAPI
* Optional: MongoDB for cloud storage

---

### ✅ 6. Delivery: Local Endpoint + Chrome Extension

#### Backend API (Local):

* Use **FastAPI + Uvicorn**
* Endpoints:

  * `/process_audio`
  * `/get_transcript`
  * `/live_stream` (optional)

#### Chrome Extension:

* **Content script** to hook audio stream via Web Audio API
* Stream mic output or tab audio to backend via WebSocket
* Display transcript in popup or UI overlay

#### Optional UI Stack:

* **Gradio / Streamlit** for local demos
* **ElectronJS** for cross-platform desktop assistant

    B --> C[Voice Enhancement (VoiceFixer)]
    C --> D[Speaker Separation (Demucs)]
    D --> E[STT for Each Speaker (Whisper)]
    E --> F[Speaker diarization + Logging]
    F --> G[FastAPI Endpoint]
    G --> H[Chrome Extension UI / Embedded Widget]
```

---

### 🧪 Dev Flow

1. **Collect 1-2 min multi-speaker noisy audio** for local testing
2. Build processing pipeline script (Python) that saves speaker-wise transcripts
3. Modularize each block into `functions/` or `modules/`
4. Quantize Whisper + VoiceFixer for deployment if needed
5. Add FastAPI wrapper
6. (Bonus) Start developing a Chrome extension to hook mic audio & query endpoint

---

### 💡 Deployment Ideas

* Docker container with CPU inference
* TorchScript or ONNX models served using `onnxruntime`
* GitHub + HuggingFace Spaces + Chrome Store

Would you like me to give you a starter repo structure and base code for the pipeline in Python (with placeholders for models)?
